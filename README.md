📘 Offline Multi-Agent AI System (Streamlit + Ollama)

A fully offline AI Multi-Agent System built using Streamlit, LangChain, and Ollama.
The application deploys three coordinated AI agents — Planner, Research, and Decision — all powered by a local LLM (Gemma 2B) without requiring any API keys or internet connectivity.

⭐ Overview

This project demonstrates how lightweight, local LLMs can be orchestrated in a multi-agent workflow to break down tasks, analyze information, and produce a refined final output.
It serves as a foundation for offline AI assistants, research tools, and automation systems.

🚀 Key Features
